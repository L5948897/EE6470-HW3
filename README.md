# ESL HW3

## Requirments

Linux system, SystemC, Stratus, Xelium

## HW3-1 Base Implementation

Use Linux system and go to /hw3-1/stratus folder. Then type

```
make sim_B
make sim_V_BASIC
```

and the output file "out2.bmp" will appear in the stratus directory, and the area and timing report will show on the terminal.

## HW3-2 Improve coding styles

Use Linux system and go to /hw3-2/stratus folder. Then type

```
make sim_B
make sim_V_BASIC
```

and the output file "out2.bmp" will appear in the stratus directory, and the area and timing report will show on the terminal.

## HW3-3 Optimized Implementation

Use Linux system and go to /hw3-3/stratus folder. Then type

```
make sim_B
make sim_V_BASIC
```

and the output file "out2.bmp" will appear in the stratus directory, and the area and timing report will show on the terminal.
